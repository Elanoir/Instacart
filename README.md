# 📊 Instacart

## 🗃️ Dataset 
- Source:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis

## 🔍 Objetive 1
- Analyze the itemset/rules generation procedure
- Make a performance analysis up to a threshold level of support
- Identify a good candidate method
- Define a good support threshold for analysis according to your computational capabilities

## 🔍 Objetive 2
- Identify the most relevant rules
- From your predefined support level generate all available itemsets and generate rules
- Identify a set of relevant rules and comment them
- Identify the Maximal and Closed Itemsets for the same level of support

[challenging] Generate the most relevant rules for closed and maximal itemsets with adequate statistics (support, confidence, lift and conviction) and discuss your findings

## 🛠️ Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.)
- Power BI / Plotly (se aplicável)
- Jupyter Notebook
