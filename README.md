Define a good support threshold for analysis according to your computational capabilities

Objective 2:

Identify the most relevant rules

From your predefined support level generate all available itemsets and generate rules

Identify a set of relevant rules and comment them

Identify the Maximal and Closed Itemsets for the same level of support

[challenging] Generate the most relevant rules for closed and maximal itemsets with adequate statistics (support, confidence, lift and conviction) and discuss your findings
